# NeuralNetwork-from-scratch
Neural Network made with Python

I been using tensorflow , keras etc for quite a while and was just curious to learn about how these Neural Network work behind the scenes.

So decided to make my own NN from scratch with python because its simple and fast (in terms of coding not execution ofcourse)

its really fun, 
came to know a lot about use of maths and stats in programming like matrix multiplication , integeration (which i use to thought of as useless piece of theory)

dont know how long its gonna take to complete but i m surely loving it :)
